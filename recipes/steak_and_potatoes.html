        <p>
            Garlic Butter Steak and Potatoes Skillet – This easy one-pan steak and potatoes 
            recipe is SO simple and SO flavorful. Juicy steak and crisp-golden potatoes are 
            pan-seared and cooked to perfection with a luscious garlic, herbs and butter 
            sauce. The thing we love with flank is that it’s a lean, yet soft cut of beef, 
            meaning this garlic butter steak recipe is nearly impossible to mess up. Ready 
            in 30 minutes or less, this is the best steak and potatoes you’ll ever have!

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To prepare the garlic butter steak recipe with potatoes wedges: 
                In a large bowl, combine the steak strips with soy sauce, olive 
                oil, pepper, and hot sauce. Set aside and allow steak strips to 
                marinate while you cook potatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive 
                oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When butter is melted, add potatoes 
                wedges. Cook for about 4 minutes, stir and cook an additional 
                4-5 minutes until potatoes wedges are golden and fork-tender. 
                Transfer sauteed potatoes to a plate and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep the same skillet over medium heat and add remaining 2 
                tablespoons butter, garlic, red chili pepper flakes, and 
                fresh herbs. Lay the steak strips in one layer in the 
                skillet, keeping the drained steak marinade for later. 
                Cook the steak strips on each side for 1 minute each, until 
                nicely browned – adjust timing depending on how you like your steak.
            </li>
            <li>
                Right before the Garlic Butter steak is done, you can stir in the 
                reserved marinade if you like, and cook for one minute. Add the 
                potatoes wedges back to the garlic butter steak pan and heat through. 
                Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and serve immediately your <strong>steak and potatoes</strong>, 
                garnished with more crushed chili pepper, fresh herbs, and a 
                sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the potatoes if you like. Enjoy!
